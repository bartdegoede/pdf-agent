## Introduction
Remember the golden days of role playing, when adventures were underground, NPCs were there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was the dragon on the 20th level? Well, those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics feature bloody combat, intriguing dungeons, and no NPCs who aren’t meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you fear, and the secret doors you know must be there somewhere.

**Idylls of the Rat King** is designed for four to six player characters of 1st- through 3rd-level. While the characters can be of any basic character class, a rogue and a good-aligned cleric are recommended for the party’s ultimate survival. At least one strong fighter with a silvered weapon would also be helpful, but is not necessary. See the “Scaling Information” section for ways to tailor this adventure to your group’s unique style of play.

### Adventure Summary
The characters have arrived in the small mining town of Silverton two days after a group of wererat goblin bandits attacked a caravan carrying silver to the city of Archbridge, to the north. The goblin tribe has taken up residence in an abandoned silver mine to the northwest of town and has been conducting these daring raids against the silver caravans for several months, crippling Silverton’s silver trade. These wererat goblins are under the leadership of a powerful human wererat bard named Lawrence Gannu, who is exacting his family’s revenge on the town of Silverton for killing his grandfather and cursing his then-infant father and grandmother before exiling them to the southern city of Soulgrave many years ago. With help from the desperate townsfolk, the characters have found their way to the entrance of the abandoned Gannu family silver mine.

### Scaling Information
**Idylls of the Rat King** is designed for 4-6 characters of 1st-3rd level, but it can be modified for parties of different sizes or levels. Consider adapting the adventure as follows:

- **Weaker Parties (3 or fewer characters)**: Reduce the number of regular goblins (or perhaps remove them entirely) in areas 1-3, 2-1, 2-2, 2-6, 2-12, and 2-18.
- **Stronger Parties (4th level and/or more than 6 characters)**: Add an additional 2 goblins to each goblin and wererat goblin encounter, and change all dire rats to fiendish dire rats.

### Getting the Players Involved
The following hooks can be used to get the players involved with the plot:

- **Silver Cup Inn**: While washing the road-dust from their throats at the Silver Cup Inn in Silverton, the characters overhear a young man telling the tale of an abandoned silver mine to the northeast of town that is the base location for goblins who have been attacking silver caravans traveling north. If the characters inquire about these events, he will offer them 200 gold pieces if they can eliminate the threat.
- **Renna the Midwife**: While visiting Renna the Midwife in Silverton for healing herbs, a young nobleman stumbles in her door very wounded. He says that he was guarding a caravan carrying silver north when it was ambushed by goblins. He was the lone survivor of the attack, left for dead, and witnessed the goblins heading east through the forest. Renna can tell the characters that there is an abandoned mine to the northeast of town that could be their lair. The young nobleman has taken to fever and may not live long. Renna would be most appreciative to the characters if they can root out the cause of this terrible event.
- **Miner’s Guild Leader**: Upon entering the small mining town of Silverton, the characters are approached by an old man that identifies himself as the leader of the Miner’s Guild in town. His operations have been sabotaged and caravans raided by goblins hailing from the northeast of town. He believes that they are being aided by some ancient evil that was the cause of closing the mining operations at an abandoned mining site a half-day’s travel northeast of town. He will reward those characters that can eliminate this threat.

### Character Death
If the party is knocked unconscious (or if a character is knocked below 0 hit points and the rest of the party flees), they are not left to die by the goblins and wererats in the mine. Instead, the characters are stripped of their equipment and are thrown into the holding cell (area 2-13). Their equipment will be kept in the jailer’s room (area 2-14). Characters will awaken in the holding cell with one-half their total hit points and no equipment. They will discover that their wounds have been bound by the goblins. The reason the characters are being saved is that Lawrence Gannu (see area 4-10) wishes to create other wererats to serve his dark rat gods.

Characters can also return to Renna’s House in Silverton for healing or to the Silver Cup Inn for rest. The midwife, Renna, will charge the party one-half of her usual fee if the characters mention that they were wounded during their foray into the abandoned mine (see appendix 1).

If a character is brought to –10 hit points or lower, the character’s dead body will be brought to Narzy Hilspek (see area 3-4) for animation as a zombie miner. The equipment of the dead character will find its way to the treasure room (area 4-12).

### Treasure
Creatures listed as having “miscellaneous coins” for treasure carry 1d6 copper pieces for normal goblins and 1d6 copper pieces + 1d4 gold pieces for everything else (excluding the undead, which have nothing). This amount is multiplied by the dungeon level or the CR, whichever is greater. For example, a normal goblin on level 2 would have 2d6 copper pieces, while a wererat goblin on level 1 would have 2d6 cp + 2d4 gp.
